Needed for server side:
* List of possible chores
* List of people to choose from for chores
* Class files for Chore_List and People






Needed for client side:
* Path for excel file to load previous selections (not necessary if server is up and running)




How it will work:
* Jonah will have client program
* Dan will run server
* Will be a script that Jonah can run through CMD or Powershell
* Jonah would need to copy and paste data from list into an excel/sheets file in case of server failure
*
